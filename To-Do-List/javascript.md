This program is a To-Do-List that you can add items to a list and remove as well.

The purpose of this project was to brush up on my HTML and CSS skills and learn how to code JavaScript.

# Development Environment

I used Chrome Inspector tool and VS Code to create these different files.

In order to create a usable file for JavaScript and the To-Do-List I used HTML and CSS as well.
