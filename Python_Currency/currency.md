# Overview

This software will convert an amount of currency into another, limited by the few options available as of now

I haven't used python in a few months so i wanted a quick refresher on the basics.

# Future Work

- I plan to add more user interface options such as typing the name or acronyms
- I plan to add more currencies and making the program more efficient/intelligent than using if statements
- I plan to display more data such as what major countries take the type of converted currency
